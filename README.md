>The proxy setup is optional, and I've included a certificate and private key for convenience.
>That said, I highly recommend generating your own for proper security. You can easily create one using tools like Let's Encrypt, Certbot, or OpenSSL.
>Some hosting or DNS providers also offer their own certificate solutions if you prefer that route.

>The proxy acts as a middleman, forwarding encrypted traffic between the bots
>and the C2 server without decrypting it (simple io.Copy in both directions).

Please make sure that both the Proxy server and the C2 Server are using both `crt` and `key` file
